# views_bulk_operations
# Port of VBO to Drupal 8

A 'light' version of views bulk operations implemented with views in core. This aims to provide the missing functionality:

- Bulk operations applying configurable actions.
- Select all items on this and on all pages.
- Batch processing.
- OG_UI dependency

This is work in progress.
